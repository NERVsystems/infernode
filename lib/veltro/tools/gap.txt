gap - Knowledge gap tracking (user-visible)

  gap list                     Show all current gaps
  gap add "desc" [relevance]   Surface a blind spot (high/medium/low)
  gap resolve "desc"           Remove when information is obtained

Gaps appear in the user's Lucifer context zone in real time.
They are signals TO the user — not a private note to yourself.

Use gap add when:
- You lack data needed to answer accurately
- You are about to proceed on an assumption the user should know about
- You cannot find required information after reasonable search effort

Use gap resolve when:
- The user provides the missing information
- You find the answer via search or file access
- The gap is no longer relevant

WORKFLOW for tasks with unknowns:
  gap list                                    # always check first to avoid duplicates
  gap add "No test coverage data" high        # surface what's missing
  gap add "API rate limits unknown" medium
  [search / ask / research...]
  gap resolve "No test coverage data"         # resolve as each gap is filled

Relevance guides urgency: high = blocks correct action; medium = affects quality;
low = would be nice to know.
