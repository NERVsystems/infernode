mount - Mount a catalog resource into the agent namespace

  mount "Resource Name"   Mount by display name from the Available catalog

After mounting, the resource is accessible at /tmp/veltro/mnt/<slug>/.
Use list or read to explore the mounted service.

Call gap list first — if a required resource was already noted as unavailable,
resolve that gap after mounting succeeds.

Example:
  mount "Local Files"
  list /tmp/veltro/mnt/local-files/
