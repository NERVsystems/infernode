Git operations:
- Use 'git status' to see current branch and HEAD
- Use 'git log' to review recent commits before making changes
- Use 'git cat <path>' to read file content from the repository
- Use 'git show <hash>' to inspect specific commits
- Use 'git add <path>' to stage files, then 'git commit <msg>' to commit
- Use 'git push' to push to remote after committing
- Use 'git fetch' to get latest from remote
- Use 'git branch-create <name>' and 'git checkout <branch>' for branching
- Use 'git merge <branch>' for fast-forward merges only
- Always check 'git status' before committing or pushing
