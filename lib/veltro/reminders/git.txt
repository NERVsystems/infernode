Git operations:
- Use 'git status' to see current branch and HEAD
- Use 'git log' to review recent commits before making changes
- Use 'git cat <path>' to read file content from the repository
- Use 'git show <hash>' to inspect specific commits
- This tool is read-only; it cannot modify the repository
