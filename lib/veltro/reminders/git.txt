Git safety protocol:
- Run 'git status' and 'git log' before any commit or push
- NEVER force-push without explicit user permission
- NEVER use --no-verify without explicit user permission
- NEVER amend published commits — create NEW commits instead
- Stage by name (git add <path>), not 'git add .' (risks exposing secrets)
- Do NOT push unless the user explicitly asks
- Unexpected state: investigate before deleting or overwriting

Commands: status / log / add <path> / commit <msg> / fetch / checkout <branch>
         branch-create <name> / merge <branch>
