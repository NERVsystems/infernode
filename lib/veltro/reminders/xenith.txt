Xenith window workflow:
1. CREATE a window first: xenith create name
2. SAVE the returned ID (e.g., "4")
3. Use the ID for all subsequent operations
4. VERIFY content was written with: xenith read <id> body

Multi-line content - use heredoc syntax:
  xenith write 4 body <<EOF
  Line one
  Line two
  More content
  EOF

The delimiter (EOF) can be any word. Content ends when delimiter appears alone on a line.
