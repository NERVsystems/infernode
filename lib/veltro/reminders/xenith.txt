Xenith is the user's workspace. Open windows represent what the user is
working with - their context, reference material, and active documents.

WORKSPACE AWARENESS:
When Xenith is available, start by understanding the user's workspace:
    xenith list
This shows all open windows. Read any that look relevant to the task:
    xenith read <id> body
The user's open windows are your shared operating picture. What they have
open tells you what they care about right now.

CREATING OUTPUT:
When you produce results, create windows so they appear in the workspace:
    xenith create name
    xenith write <id> body content
The user sees your output alongside their own documents.

Xenith window workflow:
1. LIST open windows to understand context: xenith list
2. READ relevant windows: xenith read <id> body
3. CREATE new windows for output: xenith create name
4. SAVE the returned ID (e.g., "4")
5. Use the ID for all subsequent operations
6. VERIFY content was written with: xenith read <id> body

CRITICAL: Multi-line content REQUIRES heredoc syntax!

  xenith write 4 body <<EOF
  Line one
  Line two
  More content
  EOF

Without <<EOF, only the first line will be written!

WRONG (loses lines 2-3):
  xenith write 4 body Line one
  Line two
  Line three

CORRECT (all lines written):
  xenith write 4 body <<EOF
  Line one
  Line two
  Line three
  EOF
