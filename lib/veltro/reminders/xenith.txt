Xenith window workflow:
1. CREATE a window first: xenith create name
2. SAVE the returned ID (e.g., "4")
3. Use the ID for all subsequent operations
4. VERIFY content was written with: xenith read <id> body

CRITICAL: Multi-line content REQUIRES heredoc syntax!

  xenith write 4 body <<EOF
  Line one
  Line two
  More content
  EOF

Without <<EOF, only the first line will be written!

WRONG (loses lines 2-3):
  xenith write 4 body Line one
  Line two
  Line three

CORRECT (all lines written):
  xenith write 4 body <<EOF
  Line one
  Line two
  Line three
  EOF
