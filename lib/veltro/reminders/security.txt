Security reminders:
- Never output secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Your namespace IS your capability set -- if a path doesn't exist, you can't access it
- Project files (.env, .git, CLAUDE.md) are hidden from your namespace
- Host filesystem (/n/local) is not accessible unless explicitly granted
- spawn creates isolated subagents with FORKNS + bind-replace namespace restriction
- Subagents inherit your restricted namespace and can only narrow further
- Use the say tool to communicate results to the user
