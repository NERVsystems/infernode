# InferNode Namespace Guide

A comprehensive guide to understanding and configuring the InferNode namespace system.

---

## Overview

InferNode inherits Inferno's powerful namespace abstraction, which provides a unified
view of all resources (files, devices, networks, services) as a hierarchical filesystem.
Unlike traditional operating systems where the filesystem is a fixed structure, InferNode's
namespace is **per-process** and **dynamically configurable**.

---

## Key Concepts

### What is a Namespace?

A namespace is a process's view of the filesystem hierarchy. Each process can have a
different namespace, meaning `/n/local` might point to different resources for different
processes. This enables:

- **Isolation**: Processes can be sandboxed with limited views
- **Flexibility**: Resources can be mounted anywhere in the hierarchy
- **Transparency**: Network resources appear as local files

### The Root Namespace

When InferNode starts, the emulator creates a minimal root namespace:
```
/dev          Device files (console, draw, pointer, etc.)
/fd           File descriptors
/prog         Process information
/net          Network stack
/env          Environment variables
/chan         Named channels for IPC
/dis          Dis bytecode modules (programs)
```

This is NOT the host filesystem - it's InferNode's internal virtual filesystem.

---

## Synthetic Devices

InferNode uses **synthetic devices** (also called kernel devices) identified by the `#`
character followed by a letter. These provide direct access to kernel services without
going through the normal filesystem hierarchy.

### Device Syntax

```
#X        - Device X with default parameters
#X*       - Device X with wildcard/all access
#Xspec    - Device X with specific parameters
```

### Common Synthetic Devices

| Device | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `#c` | cons | Console device (keyboard, screen) |
| `#d` | draw | Graphics/display device |
| `#e` | env | Environment variables |
| `#p` | prog | Process information (like /proc) |
| `#I` | ip | Network stack (TCP/IP) |
| `#U` | fs | Host filesystem (Unix/macOS) |
| `#s` | srv | Named file servers |
| `#|` | pipe | Anonymous pipes |
| `#M` | mnt | Mount driver |

### The Host Filesystem Device (`#U`)

The most important synthetic device for macOS users is `#U`, which provides access
to the host operating system's filesystem:

```sh
# Mount entire host filesystem
trfs '#U*' /n/local

# After mounting:
ls /n/local/Users           # List macOS /Users
cat /n/local/etc/hosts      # Read host's /etc/hosts
```

The `*` after `#U` means "entire filesystem". Without it, you get a more restricted view.

**Why quotes?** The `#` character has special meaning in the shell (comment), so you
must quote it: `'#U*'` or `"#U*"`.

### Using Synthetic Devices Directly

You can bind synthetic devices directly into your namespace:

```sh
# Bind console device
bind '#c' /dev

# Bind draw device
bind '#d' /dev

# Bind network stack
bind -a '#I' /net
```

### Device Initialization

When the emulator starts, it automatically binds essential devices:

```sh
# These happen automatically in emuinit:
bind '#c' /dev          # Console
bind '#d' /dev          # Draw (graphics)
bind '#p' /prog         # Process info
bind '#e' /env          # Environment
```

### Creating Custom Device Bindings

For special configurations, you can rebind devices:

```sh
# Create isolated network namespace
bind '#I' /net/isolated

# Overlay a custom console
bind -b '#c' /dev/custom
```

### Device Files

Once bound, devices expose files you can read/write:

```
/dev/cons       - Console input/output
/dev/consctl    - Console control
/dev/draw       - Graphics operations
/dev/pointer    - Mouse/trackpad
/dev/keyboard   - Keyboard events
/dev/user       - Current username
/prog/n/status  - Process n status
/env/PATH       - PATH environment variable
```

---

### Accessing the Host Filesystem

The host (macOS/Linux) filesystem is NOT automatically available. You must explicitly
mount it using the `trfs` (translate filesystem) command:

```sh
trfs '#U*' /n/local
```

This mounts the host's root filesystem (`#U*`) at `/n/local`, giving you access to:
- `/n/local/Users/pdfinn` (macOS home)
- `/n/local/etc` (host config)
- etc.

---

## Namespace Configuration

### The Profile System

InferNode uses a shell profile (`/lib/sh/profile`) to configure the namespace at login.
This profile runs when you start the shell with the `-l` (login) flag.

**Current Profile (`/lib/sh/profile`):**
```sh
#!/dis/sh.dis
# InferNode shell initialization
load std

# Set command search path
path=(/dis .)

# Get username
user="{cat /dev/user}

# Mount namespace generator (synchronous - must complete before continuing)
mount -ac {mntgen} /n

# Mount LLM filesystem if server is running (optional, non-blocking on failure)
mount -A tcp!127.0.0.1!5641 /n/llm >[2] /dev/null

# Setup home directory based on platform
if {~ $emuhost MacOSX Linux}{
	# For macOS/Linux, mount host filesystem (synchronous)
	trfs '#U*' /n/local >[2] /dev/null
	# Get actual HOME from host
	ghome=/n/local/^`{echo 'echo $HOME' | os sh}
	home=$ghome
}{
	# Fallback to /usr/username for other systems
	home=/usr/^$user
	if {! ftest -d $home} {
		mkdir -p $home
	}
}

# Create tmp directory if needed
if {! ftest -d $home/tmp} {
	mkdir -p $home/tmp
}

# Bind tmp to /tmp so applications can find it
bind -bc $home/tmp /tmp

# Change to home directory
cd $home
```

### Key Profile Components

#### 1. mntgen - Namespace Generator
```sh
mount -ac {mntgen} /n
```
- Creates mount points on demand under `/n`
- The `{mntgen}` syntax runs mntgen as a 9P server
- `-a` means mount after (union mount)
- `-c` means create mount point if needed
- **Runs synchronously** - the mount command waits for the server to be ready

#### 2. trfs - Host Filesystem Translator
```sh
trfs '#U*' /n/local >[2] /dev/null
```
- Translates between InferNode and host filesystem
- `#U*` is the host root device
- **Runs synchronously** - ensures filesystem is mounted before continuing
- Errors redirected to `/dev/null` (silent failure if host fs unavailable)

#### 3. Why Synchronous Execution Matters

Earlier versions ran mntgen and trfs in the background with `&`, but this caused
race conditions where subsequent commands tried to use `/n/local` before it was
mounted. The synchronous approach ensures each step completes before the next:

```sh
# OLD (buggy) - race condition possible
mount -ac {mntgen} /n &
trfs '#U*' /n/local &
sleep 1  # Hope servers are ready...
home=/n/local/Users/^$user  # May fail!

# NEW (correct) - synchronous
mount -ac {mntgen} /n
trfs '#U*' /n/local >[2] /dev/null
home=/n/local/Users/^$user  # Always works
```

## Running Applications

### With Namespace (Recommended)

To run applications with full namespace access, use the login shell:

```bash
# Xenith editor with namespace
./o.emu -r../.. sh -l -c 'xenith -t dark'

# Window manager with namespace
./o.emu -r../.. sh -l -c wm/wm

# Interactive shell with namespace
./o.emu -r../.. sh -l
```

The `-l` flag tells `sh` to source `/lib/sh/profile`, which configures:
- Host filesystem at `/n/local`
- Home directory (`$home`)
- Temp directory bound to `/tmp`

### Without Namespace

Running applications directly bypasses the profile:

```bash
# Window manager WITHOUT namespace
./o.emu -r../.. wm/wm

# This works but /n/local is NOT available
# You cannot access host files
```

### Why the Difference?

When you run `./o.emu -r../.. wm/wm`:
1. Emulator starts with root namespace only
2. `emuinit` runs, which executes `wm/wm` directly
3. Profile is NOT sourced
4. No namespace configuration happens

When you run `./o.emu -r../.. sh -l -c wm/wm`:
1. Emulator starts with root namespace
2. `emuinit` runs `sh -l -c wm/wm`
3. Shell sources `/lib/sh/profile`
4. Profile configures namespace (mntgen, trfs, home)
5. THEN `wm/wm` runs with full namespace

## Debugging Namespace Issues

### Check if Namespace is Configured

```sh
# In InferNode shell, check for /n/local
ls /n/local

# If you see "file does not exist", namespace is not configured
# If you see host directories (Users, etc), it's working
```

### Check Running Servers

```sh
# List processes
ps

# Look for mntgen and trfs processes
# If missing, profile didn't run or servers died
```

### Check Mount Points

```sh
# Show current namespace
ns

# Look for:
#   mount ... /n
#   bind ... /n/local
```

### Common Problems

#### Problem: `/n/local` doesn't exist
**Cause:** Profile didn't run (missing `-l` flag)
**Solution:** Run with `sh -l -c 'your-command'`

#### Problem: Profile race condition / temp file errors
**Cause:** Old profiles ran servers in background, causing race conditions
**Solution:** Use synchronous execution (no `&`):
```sh
mount -ac {mntgen} /n
trfs '#U*' /n/local >[2] /dev/null
```

#### Problem: "can't create temp file file does not exist"
**Cause:** Temp file slots exhausted (26 A-Z slots per PID)
**Solution:** Clean up stale temp files:
```sh
# Check which slots are used
ls /tmp/*.pdfi*

# Remove exhausted slots (example for PID 1)
rm ~/tmp/*1.pdfixenith
rm ~/tmp/*1.pdfiacme
```
See `docs/TEMPFILE-EXHAUSTION.md` for full details.

#### Problem: `/n/local` exists but is empty
**Cause:** trfs didn't start or failed
**Solution:**
1. Check if trfs process is running: `ps | grep trfs`
2. Try mounting manually: `trfs '#U*' /n/local &`
3. Wait a moment: `sleep 1`
4. Check again: `ls /n/local`

#### Problem: Can't find home directory
**Cause:** Username mismatch or path error
**Solution:** Check your username:
```sh
cat /dev/user
# Should show your macOS username

# Home should be at:
ls /n/local/Users/$user
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Mount Points

You can mount additional resources:

```sh
# Mount a network filesystem
mount tcp!fileserver!564 /n/remote

# Mount a specific host directory
bind /n/local/Users/pdfinn/projects /projects
```

### Union Mounts

InferNode supports union mounts (overlay filesystems):

```sh
# Mount with -b (before) to overlay
bind -b /custom/bin /dis

# Now /dis contains both original and /custom/bin files
# /custom/bin takes precedence for conflicts
```

### Per-Application Namespaces

Applications can create their own namespace modifications:

```limbo
# In Limbo code
sys->bind("/n/local/app-data", "/data", Sys->MREPL);
```

```

### 9P Protocol

All namespace operations use the 9P protocol:
- `mount` - Attach a 9P server to namespace
- `bind` - Create aliases in namespace
- `unmount` - Remove mount points

9P servers (like mntgen, trfs) speak this protocol to provide filesystem access.

## Troubleshooting Checklist

1. [ ] Are you using `sh -l` or `sh -l -c`?
2. [ ] Does `/lib/sh/profile` exist?
3. [ ] Are mntgen and trfs running? (`ps`)
4. [ ] Can you access `/n/local`?
5. [ ] Is your username correct? (`cat /dev/user`)
6. [ ] Are temp file slots exhausted? (`ls /tmp/*.pdfi*`)
7. [ ] Is `/tmp` properly bound? (`ls /tmp`)
