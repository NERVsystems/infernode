# nsconstruct.m - Namespace construction for Veltro agents (v3)
#
# Security Model (v3): FORKNS + bind-replace
#   Fork parent namespace, then restrict directories via bind-replace (MREPL).
#   restrictdir() replaces a directory's contents with only allowed items.
#   This is an allowlist operation — anything not explicitly placed is invisible.
#
# Capability attenuation is natural: children fork an already-restricted
# namespace and can only narrow further.
#
# Replaces v2's NEWNS + sandbox directory construction with zero file copying,
# no sandbox directory management, and no NEWNS bootstrap problem.
